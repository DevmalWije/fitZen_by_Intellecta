# FitZen - A Posture Monitoring System

FitZen is a posture monitoring system that uses computer vision to track the user's posture and provide real-time feedback to improve their posture. This project was developed as part of the Software Development Group Project module at IIT.

# Requirements

Python 3.7+
OpenCV
dlib
imutils
Numpy

To run and/or experiment on backend side, the following dependancies
should be installed, ideally creat a Virtual environment and use command "pip install <module-name>"
in the terminal, always check if you have already installed them using the command "pip list"

Mediapipe,
OpenCV,
panda,
Pickle,
Pillow,
tensorflow,
Keras

# Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage

1. Run the main.py file

# Output

The program will output the detected posture class and the timestamp of detection to a text file called posture.txt in the project directory. The file can be read and processed to obtain information on the user's posture over time.
